### Code and data for: 

#### Species-area relationships emerge from multiple coexistence mechanisms

David Garcia-Callejas, Ignasi Bartomeus, and Oscar Godoy


### Structure:

the workflow of the analyses is given by the order of the R scripts in folder "R".
In the "data" and "results" folders, each dataset is also numbered in reference to the script(s)
where it is used.

For example, the file "01_03_05_07_cummulative_richness.csv" is read by the scripts 01, 03, 05, and 07.
The results produced by each script are already stored in the "results" and "images" folder.
Note that some scripts are *very* computationally intensive, may take days or weeks to run,
even in parallel.

The most efficient way to reproduce the figures of the paper is to open the R project associated, 
and directly run the scripts 03, 04, and 07. 

### Supplementary analyses

The supplementary figures and tables can be likewise reproduced. Scripts with the prefix "S3_" 
reproduce the figure S3. Note that this set of scripts is very computationally intensive.
The script "S1_supplementary_figures" reproduces Figures S1 and S2.
The script "S2_supplementary_tables" reproduces Tables S2 and S3.
